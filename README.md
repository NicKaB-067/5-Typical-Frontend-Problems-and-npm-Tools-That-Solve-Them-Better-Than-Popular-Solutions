# 5 Typical Frontend Problems and npm Tools That Solve Them Better Than Popular Solutions
Many npm packages become standard simply because "everyone does it that way." This post covers less-known but often more effective alternatives to popular solutions.

1. Problem: Excessive dependency duplication and unstable environment

    Solution: https://pnpm.io/

    Uses symlinks and hardlinks instead of copying packages → saves up to 70% disk space (especially noticeable in projects with 
    500+ dependencies)

    Parallel installation and caching → 2× faster than npm/yarn

    Isolates dependencies per package level → prevents version conflicts 

    Used in monorepo projects by Meta, Shopify, Microsoft

2. Problem: CSS collisions and poor style scalability (overly high specificity, global side effects, non-obvious overrides)

    Solution: https://vanilla-extract.style/

    Zero-runtime: styles compile to plain CSS during build

    Typed tokens and editor autocomplete

    Local class scoping → zero conflicts

    Ideal for large design systems (Braid, Atlaskit) and advanced UI frameworks

3. Problem: Inefficient reactivity and frequent unnecessary re-renders
(complex optimization with useMemo, useCallback, memo — still slow)

    Solution: https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/

    Requires React 18+

    Fine-grained reactivity: only components dependent on changed signals update

    Simplifies state management without excessive memoization

    !!! Doesn’t replace global state managers (Redux/Zustand) in complex scenarios

    Works best in isolated UI blocks (tables, charts) where performance is critical

4. Problem: Suboptimal data handling and caching
(duplicate requests, race conditions, manual update/synchronization control)

    Solution: https://swr.vercel.app/ru + https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr-immutable

    Stale-While-Revalidate: instant cache display + background refresh

    Automatic race condition and duplicate prevention

    swr-immutable disables updates for static data → eliminates extra requests

    Perfect for SSR, static pages, and rarely-changing data (docs, catalogs)

5. Problem: Form management and validation complexity
(excessive boilerplate, manual error handling, implicit state)

    Solution: https://felte.dev/

    Small size (3.1 KB) and 0 dependencies — faster, simpler

    Zod/Yup/Superstruct validation integration

    Framework-agnostic API — supports React, Svelte, Vue 

    Ideal for small/medium forms (login, registration, feedback)

Bonus: Bundle structure opacity
(unclear "weight", build bloat causes, and redundant dependencies)

   Solution: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-visualizer
   
   Generates interactive visualization (treemap)

   Supports Rollup, Vite, Webpack

   Shows real sizes accounting for tree-shaking
